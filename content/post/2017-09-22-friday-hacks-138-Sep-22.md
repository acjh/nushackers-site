### An Introduction to Functional Programming with Scala

#### Talk Description:

This talk covers basic material about Functional programming with an example of Scala language. The baseline of this talk is built on the concept of learning a new programming language through 3 aspects: Primitives, Means of Combination and Means of Abstraction. I am also going to share my personal experience of using Scala in big enterprises and provide some examples and interesting cases. The main purpose of this talk is to acquaint the audience with some fundamental principles of functional programming, to try to rethink core problems of software engineering and to consider advantages and disadvantages of such engineering approaches. We will also talk about areas where functional programming already plays a dominant role for innovation: data streams, parallel data processing, etc.

#### Speaker Profile

Dmitry Martyanov, Senior Software Engineer in Paypal Singapore,  Risk team. Dmitry has over 5 years of professional experience with Scala in different domains like API services, Data processing, and Distributed Systems. Before moving to Singapore was an architect of enterprise data services in one of the biggest Consumer Digital Banks in the world based in Moscow where Scala was primary language for all middle-tier services.


### SQL Queries Wizardry

#### Talk Description:

SQL is a very common language used to interact with databases. However, due to its declarative nature, people often regard it as magic, giving up when facing more complex problems. Moreover, most people do not use SQL directly nowadays, using ORM (object-relational mapping) tools instead. This results in less understanding of SQL. In this talk, I will show some of the more advanced SQL techniques, using its power to solve some common but complex problems.

#### Speaker Profile

Herbert is a NUS Hackers coreteam member and a Year 3 Computer Science and Mathematics undergraduate. He did his internship as a data scientist at Twitter Singapore last summer, running SQL queries every day.
