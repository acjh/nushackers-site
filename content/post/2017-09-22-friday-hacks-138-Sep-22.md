### SQL Queries Wizardry

#### Talk Description:

SQL is a very common language used to interact with databases. However, due to its declarative nature, people often regard it as magic, giving up when facing more complex problems. Moreover, most people do not use SQL directly nowadays, using ORM (object-relational mapping) tools instead. This results in less understanding of SQL. In this talk, I will show some of the more advanced SQL techniques, using its power to solve some common but complex problems.

#### Speaker Profile

Herbert is a NUS Hackers coreteam member and a Year 3 Computer Science and Mathematics undergraduate. He did his internship as a data scientist at Twitter Singapore last summer, running SQL queries every day.
