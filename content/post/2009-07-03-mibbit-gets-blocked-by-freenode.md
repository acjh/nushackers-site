If any of you use mibbit to access freenode, you should already know by now that <a href="http://blog.freenode.net/2009/06/new-freenode-webchat-and-why-to-use-it/">Freenode blocks Mibbit</a>.

Until the ban is lifted, you may wish to access <a href="http://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=linuxnus">#linuxnus using the webchat</a> powered by <a href="http://qwebirc.org/">qwebirc</a>
